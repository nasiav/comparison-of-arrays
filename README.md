# comparison-of-arrays
In this exercise the programm had to read two arrays (of the same and given size) of integers  and write "yes"if the content of them was the same and if not, write "no" and then the smallest and greatest of the 'single' numbers, that didn't exist in both arrays .I think there's a lot of optimization that can be done.
